\# Facial Expression Recognition using FacialExpressionModel

This repository contains code for a real-time facial expression recognition system using the \`FacialExpressionModel\` class. The system detects faces in a video stream, predicts the emotions of the detected faces, and overlays the predicted emotion label on the video frames.

## Description

The \`FacialExpressionModel\` class is designed to recognize facial expressions from images using a pre-trained deep learning model. It loads a trained Keras model from files and performs facial expression recognition on input images.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.6 or higher is installed.
- Required libraries are installed. You can install them using \`pip\`:

  \`\`\`bash
  pip install opencv-python numpy
  \`\`\`

## Getting Started

To get started with using the \`FacialExpressionModel\` class, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the \`FacialExpressionModel.py\` file.

2. Import the \`FacialExpressionModel\` class in your Python code:

   \`\`\`python
   from FacialExpressionModel import FacialExpressionModel
   \`\`\`

3. Initialize the \`FacialExpressionModel\` by providing paths to the JSON model architecture and the model weights files:

   \`\`\`python
   model = FacialExpressionModel("path/to/model.json", "path/to/model_weights.h5")
   \`\`\`

4. Use the \`predict_emotion\` method to predict emotions from facial images:

   \`\`\`python
   emotion = model.predict_emotion(image)
   print("Predicted Emotion:", emotion)
   \`\`\`

## Usage

- The \`predict_emotion\` method takes a facial image (numpy array) as input and returns the predicted emotion label.

- You can integrate the \`FacialExpressionModel\` class into your own projects for real-time emotion recognition from webcam or image sources.
