# Facial Expression Recognition with Keras

This project focuses on Facial Expression Recognition using the Keras library. The goal is to build deep learning models that can accurately detect and classify facial expressions from images or video data.

## Features

- Utilizes the Keras library for developing facial expression recognition models.
- Implements deep learning techniques to analyze facial features and interpret emotions.
- Supports classification of various facial expressions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and more.
- Suitable for applications in human-computer interaction, psychology, and emotion recognition research.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/facial-expression-recognition.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd facial-expression-recognition`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset of facial expression images or videos.
2. Preprocess the data by resizing, cropping, or augmenting if necessary.
3. Train the facial expression recognition model using the provided training script: `python train.py`.
4. Evaluate the trained model on the test dataset: `python evaluate.py`.
5. Use the trained model for real-time facial expression recognition by running the `realtime.py` script.
